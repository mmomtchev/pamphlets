# Should Open Source Authors and Projects Make Political Statements?

At one point during the second phase of my extortion, I did an interview with one small tech startup. The interviewer, who was also the CEO, referred to the `#SupportUkraine` banner on my Github page - and told me that he found that I was a little bit too political.

Obviously, he didn't mean the small Ukraine banner - he was much more bothered by the other 99.5% of the content there. As this content did not refer to an ongoing political debate - but rather to a very criminal affair - he did not dare to directly mention it. I have already discussed at great lengths this part - and I continue to speak about it at every occasion - but this time I would prefer to focus on the other 0.5%.

***For the record, I absolutely refuse to divulge the name of the company who did this. My moral compass, which has been tuned to the results of Game Theory, mandates that I do not punish what was could have been a simple mistake. This principle is also deeply embedded in our Judiciary. As I am a righteous person, I also reserve myself the right to extend this principle to multiple mistakes by other righteous parties - as Game Theory confirms that there are cases where this might be the best k-stable evolutionary behavior.***
*Additionally, I would like to insist that similar events took place during more than one interview.*

So, after this brief introduction and the well-needed disclaimer, let's get right to the point.

**Should Open Source Authors and Projects Make Political Statements?**

First of all, grass-roots political activism is one of the most fundamental core principles of any open society. In fact, grass-roots political activism is maybe even more important than having a flawless political system. A perfect political system simply ensures that it is always the ideal person that finds its way to power. Nothing more, nothing less.

On the other side, grass-roots political activism is a safety feature. It ensures that should the current political stance of any government become so obviously wrong and so contrary to someone's interests - as to make his expend his personal means, prestige and public image - then his acts can be converted to political capital according to his own social status - and the reach of his words.

It is a very important feature of any open society.

Speaking out - very often against government policies - based only on principles alone and not any personal interest - used to be something that was traditionally done by the Church - an institution that has all but disappeared in modern society.

As speaking out against public policies always carries at least some negative consequences for the one who decides to do it, it is typically expected from people who cannot easily lose anything they have.

This evidenced by the fact that during the last few decades, this unpleasant task has been very frequently carried out by members of the show business and especially the cinema stars. These spoiled brats of the modern society have perfectly fulfilled their role - as being spoiled is traditionally associated with having a noble character - and their duty to society.

We, as engineers, cannot and should not allow artistically-minded people to be the only conduits of consciousness in our modern society. We are very well aware that our way of thinking is radically different from theirs - and we know that our opinion should be at least as important as theirs. Additionally, engineers also tend to be spoiled brats in today's world - and particularly authors of major open-source projects who also fulfill very well the requirement of being in a position where they cannot easily lose anything.

Thus, political activism should be a very important duty of any author of a major open-source project.
