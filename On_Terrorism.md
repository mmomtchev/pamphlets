# On Terrorism

Many people of my generation - I am born on the very limit between the generation X and the generation Y (the so-called Millennials) - mistakenly consider that the 21st century is the century which saw the birth of the large-scale international terrorism. They consider terrorism to be one of its most defining features.

Even if terrorism is older than this, there is some truth to this idea - because it is during the 21st century that global terrorism became a global problem.

It even saw the very first attempt to define it, an attempt that drew huge criticism of everyone who was still fighting for something - something that most of the European and American populations have more or less forgotten.

***Terrorism is the use or the threat of using physical violence for advancing a political agenda***.

Wait? Seriously?

So the current French state was born out of a series of terrorist acts that culminated in mass beheadings?

And no, the era during which everything happened cannot be part of this definition. This is why everyone outside the EU and the US reacted to this definition.

When Gorbachev passed away a few months ago, I said that the 20th century is the time period that passed between Gavrilo Princip and Mikhail Gorbachev. What started with Gavrilo Princip didn't really end until Gorbachev. 100 million deaths, 80 years of international tension, including 40 years during which the idea of peace was two super-powers with a gun to each other's head while having their fingers on the trigger. All because one 16 year old, diagnosed with the then-incurable tuberculosis, who had no more than few years left to live, decided that he wanted to change the world before he died. And change it he did. Destiny even gave him enough time to see the Great War before finally succumbing to his illness.

In fact, me and modern terrorism, we share the same birthplace - the Balkans. It appeared during the late 19th century in the crumbling Ottoman Empire - which was ruling over an increasingly discontent population of a very different culture, ethnicity and religion. It was almost immediately followed by the Northern Ireland conflict. This was the very first time that all the necessary elements were brought together, namely:
* A modern (not feudal) society based on money where there is no perceived right to rule by birth
* A ruling caste that cannot be replaced - with the added very aggravating circumstance that is of different culture, religion and ethnicity
* Economic downturn
* Other ongoing wars

During this period, currently called *"The National Revival"*, various grass-roots independence movements started appearing. Some of them were more violent than others. They were styling themselves *Komiti* - after the old nobility titles of the Medieval Balkan states - just like many modern arab terrorist leaders style themselves *Emirs*. In fact, Hezbollah has even admitted that *VMRO*, the most resilient terrorist organization on the Balkans during the 19th century, has been a model that they followed during their early years. They pioneered many tactics that were to be fielded later by other similar organizations - financing operations by robberies, blowing up civilian targets and extorting the local population.

Today, all of these so-called *National Revival* figures are unequivocally considered freedom fighters. In the Balkans, they are some of the most revered national heroes. I don't think that even the modern Turkish state would dare call them terrorists. They have firmly secured their place on the good side of history. On the other side, Gavrilo Princip used to be considered a national hero during the Tito era in Yugoslavia - then once again he became a terrorist after Croatia and Bosnia seceded.

How comes this? Why are some rebels considered freedom fighters and others - terrorists. Is it only because they won? Or is there some absolute line, not depending on the times, the society, the culture and the people that one is not supposed to cross in order to become a freedom fighter instead of being branded a terrorist?

I think there is.

In fact, look around you - it is always very difficult to brand someone a terrorist when he is fighting for the rights of an oppressed ethnical minority. No matter the situation, these combatants are almost always perceived as freedom fighters and not terrorists. Their cause is almost always considered a just one.

Usually, when I have to apply my own moral compass, I have come to use a definition that I have always found a very precise one that transcends any cultural boundaries:

***If the state threatens your physical existence when you express your views and try to convert people, you are justified in using physical force.***

Thus the right definition is:

***Terrorism is the unnecessary use or the threat of using physical violence for advancing a political agenda***.

Ridiculing you and ostracizing you does not count - even if it definitely justifies at least some form of dirty fighting. Only physical violence justifies physical violence.
