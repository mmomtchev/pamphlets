# Why Protecting Personal Data Matters

### *and does so even more than size*

Before I begin, I would like to remind you about two recent very high-profile criminal cases - both involving serial killers - that were recently solved thanks to huge advances in data processing. Serial killers are notoriously difficult to catch. Motive is usually the first lead during a criminal investigation. And in the case of a serial killer, the motive is irrational and the victim is completely random. Massive automated data processing has completely transformed this kind of investigation. Both Nordahl Lelandais (*in France*) and Rex Heuermann (*in the US*) were caught because their mobile phones beamed together with their victims' phones as they moved together from cell tower to cell tower during the hours preceding their murders. Both crimes were solved years after having been committed. If you - like me - asked yourself the legitimate question - for how long do operators keep this data, well the answer is simple. These days, in the case of a serious crime, law enforcement simply routinely collects the print-outs from the cellular towers for future use. Usually, there will be a large number of phones. But once they have a suspect, they can simply check if his phone is on their list.

However, in another very high-profile case, the disappearance of Delphine Jubillar (*in France*), the investigators were remarkably clumsy with her mobile phone and they do not know anything else except location of the last cell tower her Android phone beamed to. The additional data from the Assisted GPS bootstrapping that Google has implemented was not available. As, **officially**, this data is not collected on a per-user basis, so it is not available to the police.

The massive switch to computer processing of all kinds of data during the last few decades has allowed to easily process enormous quantities of data. This has completely transformed almost all aspects of everyday life - and has created an absolutely horrible byproduct - the total surveillance society many dystopian authors have been warning against for generations.

No one argues that this new surveillance society has allowed to much easily solve crimes that were next to impossible to solve before. And when it comes to the political implications, there is a very vocal minority that continuously beats the drum, but the truth is that the average citizen does not really care.

> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew.
And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak.

These days, in high-HDI, supposedly democratic states, very few people are truly repressed. As an anarchist I can ensure you that, unless you start buying large quantities of fertilizer while living in a high rise building, chances are no one will keep a tab on you. Communists, extreme right-wing militias and survivalists, as long as you do not do plan any destructive action, no one will really spy on you. Very radical Islam is probably the last frontier. Then, of course, there is industrial espionage. As Snowden made everyone aware, this is very real and very modern - in terms of data processing capabilities. But what does the average citizen have to do with it? Does he really care? This is the government's job.

However when it comes to my case, I got the taste of something that few of you ever thought possible. Massive total surveillance as part of a purely criminal extortion affair. France does not really have a mafia, but this affair is as close as it can get. By companies such as Google, Free, X, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, backed by the French authorities - because everyone needed a way out.

How did we get here? 30 or 40 years ago, running an illegal wiretap on someone's phone was next to inconceivable. These devices were installed by the police, authorized by a judge, and handled by a special person in the phone company. Installing an illegal one would require a huge number of accomplices, all of them risking very severe sentences. Data processing changed this. Data processing allows the centralization of all data in a single place. You don't need any special wiretapping devices anymore - only a number of keystrokes. Despite massive progress in computer security, protecting a system from its own system administrators is still something no one does. The owner of the system is trusted by definition.

These days, I have to routinely switch off my mobile phone, find clever ways to never pass the automated doors of the Parisian subway and never use my bankcard except to draw money at a known location. Otherwise, all kind of strange stuff starts happening to me and I cannot afford costly repairs to my van.

Google and Free's reaction to this situation - in which they were obviously dragged in - is also completely remarkable. They have decided to actively help the extortion to succeed - in order to avoid any damage. Google seem to use even the data they denied to law enforcement - because they were not supposed to possess it.

*They say every dictator's first job is to render the method he used to ascend to power illegal*

*Then every freedom fighter's most important job should be to render the method he used to avoid capture, permanently open*

As these days I meet with lots of political activists - of the traditional street type - I have come to notice how they dear their rights to *Freedom of Assembly* and *Freedom of Speech*. Well, in my case, this would be anonymous travel - something for which my days seem numbered. Because the day they install face recognition on the CCTV in the subway, I will be toasted.

## The case for advertising

One of the industries that has been completely transformed by automated data processing of personal data is advertising. A few years ago I bought a funny T-shirt with a joke about paragliding referring a famous ad in France (*the Aquaponey ad if you are in France*). I bought it clicking an ad on Facebook - someone had the good business idea to market his product exclusively to paragliding pilots. This was an expensive ad - but it must have worked very well - definitely enough for him to make a profit. This kind of business would have been impossible a few decades ago - marketing a product directly to everyone who was speaking French and was into paragliding.

This is a legitimate use of personal data and it is one that should continue to be allowed. However getting the phone numbers, and the email and home addresses of every paragliding pilot in France who bought penis-enlargement pills during the last 6 months and whose wife made online search for family therapy is not. And yet, this is something that today is entirely possible. Not only this information is available to the highest bidder for selling products - it is also available to the criminal underworld to serve for extortions. And this is where it becomes a huge problem.
