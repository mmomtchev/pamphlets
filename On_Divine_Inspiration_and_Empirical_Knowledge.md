# Divine Inspiration in the Absence of Revelation

A basic tenet of all Abrahamic religions is that their holy scriptures are divinely inspired and cannot be wrong.

How can Game Theory explain such divine inspiration without the need for revelation?

I still vividly remember the introductory short story of a Russian-language book on probability theory I read when I was still a kid.

A large group of mathematicians went for a walk in the park at a time when mechanical clocks were still the norm. Being very forgetful, they found themselves deep in the forest and without a working watch. Afraid they could miss the last train, they had to find a way to deduce the time. So they decided to write their estimates on a piece of paper - to avoid influencing each other - and then averaged all the estimates. They wound the watch they had and when they came back to the train station, they discovered that they were mere seconds off the mark.

Most of the holy scriptures haven't been written by a single person. Especially in the case of what the Christians call the Old Testament, the Jews the Miqra, and the Muslim the Sura, these texts are simply the written versions of centuries-old oral stories that have been transmitted over the generations. They are so old, they predate writing and their origin cannot be accurately traced.

As such, these stories are in fact the product of evolution - the same divine process that resulted the creation of all Life.

Just as the mathematicians were able to smooth out each one's erroneous estimate, these stories are also remarkably correct representation of human nature.

They simply cannot be wrong. The holy scriptures of any major religion with millions of followers can never be wrong on the subject of human nature. These texts are indeed divinely inspired. They can surely be improved - as gaining additional accuracy is always possible. They might have cultural nuances. Different rituals. Different life-style choices. They may be adapted to different periods of time. But they can never have any glaring errors when it comes to human nature. It is mathematically impossible.
