# Is Assisted Suicide Contrary to God's Will in Game Theory?

Almost all traditional religions are completely unanimous on suicide - it is forbidden and considered a major sin.

Despite all the social progress of the 20th century - and the breakdown of most social taboos - suicide remains one of the very few such issues that survived throughout the sexual revolution and were carried over in the 21th century.

Even outside of religion - most countries have suicide prevention hot lines and it is generally accepted that everything must done in order to prevent someone preparing to commit a suicide - including by the use of force. Police officers will usually have some basic training and, generally speaking, law enforcement will be prepared to deal with a case of an attempted suicide - despite the fact that suicide is not a crime in most jurisdictions.

The underlying mechanism of natural suicide are still not completely understood - but they *could* be valid under a strict interpretation of Game Theory and evolution. An individual that relieves its group from the extra care that he needs, might be an evolutionary beneficial trait. It should be stressed that *could* and *might* have to be used - since we still do not have a mathematically precise complete Game Theory model of evolution. For example, according to Richard Dawkins - and his very strict - and somewhat controversial - completely gene-based model - suicide could be evolutionary beneficial only in cases where it is completely impossible for the individual to have a descendant. According to other models, this is not always true.

However whatever the final result of this very important scientific research will be, it is already clear that there *might* be cases where suicide *could* be evolutionary beneficial - and thus not contrary to God's will.

Then how is it possible that all classical religions did hold an erroneous view on this subject? After all, Game Theory does accept the basic tenet that their sacred works do indeed come from God?

*For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Romans 11:34*

God works in mysterious ways.

Just as in many other cases, the insight of nature of our ancestors was globally surprisingly correct - because it was truly the product of a divine inspiration - but certainly lacking in details and understanding.

Suicide remains, in the vast majority of cases, a product of an individual error - and given its consequences - it is correct to consider it a special case of a mental health issue.

It remains an act with which few people have valid first-hand experience - which means that progress is slow.

And in the absence of a profound understanding of its underlying mechanics - something that we do not yet posses even in 2024 - and we are unlikely to understand in a near future - a complete ban could be considered to be the lesser evil.

However as our knowledge increases, it is absolutely valid to doubt this absolute ban - all while continuing to shun this ultimate act of surrender.
