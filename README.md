# Political Pamphlets

As the affair surrounding me has reached a stage where the limit between madness and rationality is becoming blurred, I have decided to start publishing political pamphlets in this repository.

These will serve 3 different goals:

* First of all, I would like to thank all the criminals involved - especially those working for the French state - for giving me the platform and the opportunity to express my beliefs to a very large public and very interested public;

* Second, I hope that these will serve my ultimate goal of winning against this sexually-motivated criminal conspiracy which is now backed by the French state;

* Third, even if I am not born in France, I have been here through most of my adult life, and there are very good chances that I will stay here at least until my retirement - which means that I would like to contribute towards the common public good and to help to reform the Judicial system.


Essays:
* [On Armed Struggle and Terrorism](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pamphlets/blob/master/On_Armed_Struggle_and_Terrorism.md) - As I currently maintain that the French Judiciary is a criminal judicial system - which is a statement usually associated with terrorism - as a very first step, I would like to express my views on terrorism

* [On 2023][https://github.com/mmomtchev/pamphlets/blob/master/On_Fiducia_supplicans.md] - My thoughts on 2023
